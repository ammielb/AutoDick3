## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
